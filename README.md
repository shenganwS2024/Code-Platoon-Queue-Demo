# React Code Platoon Simplied Queue Demo

To run this demo on your machine, please install all required node modules by running ```npm install```
, then start the web in you localhost by running ```npm run dev```

There are two versions of queues; 'backup.jsx' with the 'components_back' folder creates a componentized queue; and the 'App.jsx' file is linked with the 'component' folder, which creates the queue that I demostrated during the class.
